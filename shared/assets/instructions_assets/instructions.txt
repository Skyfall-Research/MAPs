Before starting the layouts that you will be evaluated on, 
You will have {max_sandbox_steps} in-game days in a sandbox mode to explore and interact with the environment.
Use this period to learn how the game works and experiment with different actions and strategies.
During this sandbox mode, you will have access to several additional commands:
undo_day, max_money, max_research, reset, and switch_layouts.
