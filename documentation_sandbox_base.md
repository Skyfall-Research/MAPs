## Sandbox Mode

The game can be placed in sandbox mode to help with learning or exploring the environment. In sandbox mode, players have access to new actions that are useful for experimenting with the game. These actions are likewise written as python function calls (see [Action Space](#action-space)).

When in sandbox mode, the game permits the player to perform {{sandbox_mode_steps}} normal actions and an unlimited number of sandbox actions.
